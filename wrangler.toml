# NOTE: Configure `RESEND_API_KEY`, `NOTIFICATION_TOKEN`, etc. as Wrangler secrets:
# wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
# wrangler secret put NOTIFICATION_TOKEN
# wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
# wrangler secret put ADMIN_PIN
#
# Optional (recommended for zero-downtime JWT rotation):
# - Set `JWT_SECRET` to a new random secret (used for signing new tokens)
# - Set `JWT_SECRET_PREVIOUS` to the prior secret for a limited time (tokens issued
#   under the old secret keep working until expiry), then remove it.

# Cron triggers for /api/notifications should be created through Cloudflare Scheduled Functions
# (or via dashboard) once deployed.
