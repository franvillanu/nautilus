# Git Commit & Push Gate — MANDATORY (No Exceptions)

**You MUST commit and push ALL modified files before you tell the user the work is done.**

## Trigger

Before responding "Done", "Complete", "Fixed", "Here are the changes", or any similar completion message:

1. Run `git status`
2. If there are ANY modified or untracked files → commit and push them
3. Do NOT tell the user work is complete while files remain uncommitted

## Required Steps

```
git status
```

If output shows modified/untracked files:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "descriptive message"
git push
```

## Scope

- **All** modified files: app.js, dist/*, src/*, style.css, index.html, tests/*, etc.
- **Including** build outputs (dist/) and index.html bundle hashes
- Run `npm run build` first if you changed source files that affect the bundle

## Rule

**Violation = telling the user work is done while `git status` shows uncommitted changes. Never skip. No exceptions.**

If you made edits, your final action before the completion message MUST be a successful `git push`.
